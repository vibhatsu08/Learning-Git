# Learning-Git
This repository is for the notes that I am currently making in my journey while learning Git and Github through Colt Steele's Udemy course. <br/>

LearningLog[0] - I had a basic idea of what Git and Github is/are, and how to get work done, but i wanted to get an in depth learning of how the technology works. Starting from today.<br/>
LearningLog[1] - In this log, I started with learning what Git and Github is/are. Learnt about the short history of Git and it's connection with Linus Torvalds. What does Git help with and etc.<br/>
LearningLog[2] - In this log, i learnt about git based GUIs, like Gitkraken, helps to visualize commits done in Git. It's quite interesting to be able to visualize the commits with the help of these Graphical User Interfaces, although it's slower compared to terminal usage of Git. Also learnt to install and update Git and installed GitKraken.<br/>
LearningLog[3] - In this log, just re read the basic Terminal commands, like ls, pwd, cd, mkdir, touch, rm, rmdir and many more. Learnt about the other git commands for nagivating through directories and folders, like 'cd -', 'cd ~', 'cd ..' etc.<br/>
LearningLog[4] - In this log, i learnt about the the staging area, how to push files to the staging area and then how to commit files from the staging area. I learnt about the Git committing workflow. Learnt about Git messages/descriptions, how files are tracked through various changes, and how Git keeps a record of all the changes made via commits.<br/>
LearningLog[5] - In this log, I learnt about Atomic commits, how to keep your commits to the point and what to keep in mind.
How to write better git messages/descriptions using the VIM editor and also configuring your IDE for the same.<br/>
LearningLog[6] - In this log, I learnt about creating and switching branches. The difference between checkout and switching branches' commands. Basically how to create a branch using the 'git branch branchname' command, how to see the branches that you have using the 'git branch' command, how to switch to a branch that you just created, with the 'git switch branchname' command, and in case that all feels too tedious and a long procedure to create and switch to a branch, the best way is to use the 'git switch -c branchname', this command not only creates a branch, but also switches to that branch that you just created. <br/>
LearningLog[7] - In this log, i learnt what happens when i try to switch to a branch without saving/commiting the previous work done on the branch. <br/>
LearningLog[8] - In this log, i solved the Branching Excercise given in the course. <br/>
