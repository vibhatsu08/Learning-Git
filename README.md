# Learning-Git
This repository is for the notes that I am currently making in my journey while learning Git and Github through Colt Steele's Udemy course. <br/>

LearningLog[0] - I had a basic idea of what Git and Github is/are, and how to get work done, but i wanted to get an in depth learning of how the technology works. Starting from today.<br/>
LearningLog[1] - In this log, I started with learning what Git and Github is/are. Learnt about the short history of Git and it's connection with Linus Torvalds. What does Git help with and etc. <br/>
LearningLog[2] - In this log, i learnt about git based GUIs, like Gitkraken, helps to visualize commits done in Git. It's quite interesting to be able to visualize the commits with the help of these Graphical User Interfaces, although it's slower compared to terminal usage of Git. Also learnt to install and update Git and installed GitKraken.<br/>
